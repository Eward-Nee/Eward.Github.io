                    I am Eward van Niekerk. I am a man who wants to work hard.
                    I don't like laziness, and I don't like imperfections.
                    I like coding and challenges. I am currently learning to
                    code by watching Brocode's videos. I also downloaded some
                    textbooks to work through when I am done with his videos.
                    Currently, I am watching his 4-hour video about HTML and CSS.
                    After that video, I will watch his JavaScript video.
                    When I learn how to link a database to my code, I will add a
                    comment section to my website for any feedback and tips on improving
                    my website and also improving my skills. I want to open my own
                    business to help people in need of a great-looking website to get one.

                    I will provide a link to the source code files on GitHub in my footer.
                    I will appreciate any advice on my GitHub page.
