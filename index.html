            <h3 style="color: aqua;"> This is my first website that I am going to try to host.</h3>

            <p> My mission is to become as good at programming as I am capable of, so to reach my goal, I must work
                hard. I have decided that I will learn at least 10 hours a day until I know all the languages that will
                help me become better in the fields of IT I'm interested in (or I get a job and can only learn 3 hours a
                day after work).

            <p>I Just finnished Brocode's video about HTML and CSS and damn. I like what I have
                learned. I am going start learning Js now and I cant wait to see what I will
                be able to do when I am well aquinted with JS. I must say that I am very glad that
                I have such a passion for development, because it helps me to put in insane
                hours to learn everyting.
