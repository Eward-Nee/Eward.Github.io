            <p> This is my first website that I am going to try to host.</p>

            <p> My mission is to become as good at programming as I am capable of, so to reach my goal, I must work
                hard. I have decided that I will learn at least 10 hours a day until I know all the languages that will
                help me become better in the fields of IT I'm interested in (or I get a job and can only learn 3 hours a
                day after work).
